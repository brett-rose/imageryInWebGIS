##Imagery Examples in the JavaScript API
Originally Developed by Wenxue Ju (@wju)
###These are the javascript code samples for the Esri technical workshop: Imagery in a WebGIS
Currently using ArcGIS JavaScript API 3.13

The samples include: 
* Rendering rasters using ArcGISImageServiceLayer and RasterLayer.
* Processing rasters using server-side raster functions and client-side pixel filters (html5, WebGL).
* Profiling elevation data and time series data using image service identify, getSamples REST APIs.
* Extracting information from image service and representing them using charts.
* Rendering and processing multidimensional data (including vector field data).
* Visualizing oblique imagery and performing building height measurements.

1. Deployment instruction:
Unzip to your web server, e.g. 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\imagery2016' 
Access them through your web server: e.g. http://localhost/imagery2016
Use Chrome if possible as these samples were not well tested on other browsers.

2. Samples

Please see http://localhost/imagery2016 for a list of samples.

Some samples may require an ArcGIS online organization account to access the image services.
